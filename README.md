# JellyTube

Check out deployment on GitHub pages at https://akhileshm97.github.io/JellyTube/

I have used Font Awesome library for icons. All the styling has been done using pure CSS and interactivity using JavaScript.

Theme selection can be done using the menu button at top right corner in the navbar. 
The page is mobile-friendly and light-weight.
